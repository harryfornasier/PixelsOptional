# PixelsOptional

PixelsOptional is a platform for sharing images taken with retro cameras, including both film and early digital models. The project is live and accessible at [PixelsOptional](https://pixels-optional.vercel.app).

Feel free to make an account and post some photos, preferably from an older camera. Make sure to use a random password when you make your account!  
Although it asks for an email when you sign up, there is currently no functionality tied to emails, so you can use a fake email if you wish.

## Features

- Upload and share pictures captured with retro devices.
- Like and comment on pictures from other people
- Select your own user icon for your account
- View posts made by other accounts


### The like pot

  The "pot" feature in your profile limits likes based on a "like pot." You can only like photos if you have likes in your pot, which decreases as you use them. Receiving likes refills your pot, so it never runs out. Received likes are visible to others and can only increase. Self-liking is not allowed. This system adds a strategic element to liking photos.

## Technologies

- **Frontend**: JavaScript, SCSS, Vite.js.
- **Hosting**: Vercel.

## Things I'd Like to Add

Future ideas for improving PixelsOptional:
- **Categories**: Allow users to filter photos by different categories for easier browsing.
- **Monthly Competitions**: Introduce a feature where users can participate in monthly challenges by taking photos of the same theme. The photo with the most likes at the end of the month wins.
